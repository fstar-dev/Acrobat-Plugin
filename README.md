# Acrobat Plug-ins

Acrobat plug-ins are written in C++ and are by far the most powerful way to automate Acrobat. They have deep access into the internals of both Acrobat and PDF. They are also platform dependent and difficult to create. The developer requires expert knowledge of Acrobat, the PDF structure, and C++ programming.

## Requirements

- [Acrobat® Pro DC SDK](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat.html), or Acrobat X/XI SDK from the same link
- Visual Studio 2010, 2015, or Xcode 8.2 on Mac OS X 10.11 (tested)

## Before building the plugins

Copy the `PluginSupport` folder from Acrobat® SDK (for Mac or Windows) to current folder.
